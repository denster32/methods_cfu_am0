# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?   I feel pretty confident
- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own? Really good, simple being the operative word
- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!) What are methods capable of?
